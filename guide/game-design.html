            <p class="article-paragraph">There is a plethora of resources available on the internet there to help you learn 3D game development, but through my own efforts to learn I've found the path a little hard to see. Where do I start? What are all the things I need to learn? In order to make a 3D game, one (or a team) needs a lot of different skills and a lot of patience to learn it all. The sheer amount can be daunting and overwhelming.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">In this site you will find few, if any, tutorials produced by me. The internet has plenty of those already. This site is here to help guide the aspiring 3D game developer by attempting to lay out the necessary skills in an organized fashion, show you how or where to learn them, and maybe offer a little advice from a fellow novice.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">But I am mostly here to share my own journey towards 3D game development. Through my blog posts, I'd like to show that it's okay to suck. Skills don't come immediately, so I'd like to show that it's okay to be bad at this, or confused, or lost; it's all part of the learning process. Hopefully this website will help motivate aspiring developers to stay the course, and maybe even help them do so.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Let me end with a warning that this site is not perfect. I myself am currently learning as quickly as possible, but information may be lacking until I get there.</p>
